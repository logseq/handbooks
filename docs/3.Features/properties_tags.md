You can add a tag property to any page in Logseq to categorize it with one or more keywords. Tags are words that start with `tag::` followed by a comma-separated list of keywords. For example, you can add a tag property called `book`, `fiction`, `sci-fi` to a page called `Dune` and use it to filter your pages by their tags. Tags are useful for organizing your pages and finding related topics in your graph.
