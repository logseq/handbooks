With Logseq, you can make your notes public and share them with others on your website or GitHub pages. You can do this by adding `public:: true` property to any page you want to publish. Only the pages that have this property will be visible to others when you publish your graph. This feature allows you to showcase your work and potentially collaborate with others more easily.
