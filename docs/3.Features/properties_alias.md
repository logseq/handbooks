With Logseq, you can use different names for the same page in your notes by adding one or more aliases to it. Aliases are alternative titles that start with `alias::` followed by a comma-separated list of names. For example, you can add an alias called `NYC` to a page called `New York City` and use either name to link to the same page. Aliases help you avoid duplicate pages and create synonyms for your concepts.
