You can add one or more aliases to any page in Logseq to use different names for the same page. Aliases are alternative titles that start with `alias::` followed by a comma-separated list of names. For example, you can add an alias called `AI` to a page called `Artificial Intelligence` and use either name to link to the same page. Aliases are useful for avoiding duplicate pages and creating synonyms for your concepts.
