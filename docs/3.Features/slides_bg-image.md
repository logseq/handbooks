Make your slides more attractive and engaging with background images. To add a background image to a block, add a `background-image` property to it like `background-image:: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1498855926480-d98e83099315`. Logseqâ€™s slide feature is powered by the awesome Reveal.js. You can also set other attributes for the blocks in your slides by replacing the attribute name you find in the [reveal.js documentation](https://revealjs.com/backgrounds/) from `data-xyz` to `xyz`. For example, to change the background color of a block, you can use `background-color:: aquamarine` instead of `data-background-color="aquamarine"`. This feature is great for adding visual interest and context to your slides.
