You can add a filters property to any page in Logseq to filter its linked references by certain values. Filters are queries that start with `filters::` followed by a map of key-value pairs. For example, you can add a `filters` property to a page called `Design` and show only the blocks that mention `Design` on a specific date. Filters are useful for narrowing down your search and focusing on relevant information.
