You can test your memory and recall of the information you have stored in your Logseq notes by reviewing flashcards. You can access the flashcards youâ€™ve created so far by clicking on the `Flashcards` tab in the left sidebar. A modal overlay will open that shows you one flashcard at a time. You can click on `Show answer` to reveal the answer behind the `::` or click on `Next` to move to the next flashcard. The flashcards are ordered based on your last review of them, so that you see the ones that you are most likely to forget first. You can also click on `Reset` to start over from the beginning. If you review your flashcards regularly it helps you improve your retention and learning efficiency.
