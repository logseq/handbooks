Beside selecting text you can also highlight any part of a PDF document by pressing `Cmd/Ctrl` and dragging your cursor over the desired area. You can then reference these area in other parts of your graph and click on it to jump back to the PDF. Using a highlighted area is a great way to annotate PDFs with images or figures.
