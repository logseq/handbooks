Create and embed blocks on a whiteboard to arrange your knowledge in new ways. Blocks are versatile units of information that can contain text, images, links, or other media. You can create a block by double-clicking on the canvas, typing in the quick add box and hitting `Enter`. You can embed a block from your graph by searching for it in the quick add box and selecting it from the results. You can also drag and drop a block from the right sidebar or copy and paste its reference onto the canvas. Blocks on your whiteboard can be resized, moved, grouped, linked, or styled as you wish. Visualize and connect your notes, ideas, or tasks on a flexible canvas.
