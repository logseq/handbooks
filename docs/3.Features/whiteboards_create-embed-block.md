Logseq lets you create and embed blocks on your whiteboard that can contain text, images, links, or other media. You can use blocks to capture your thoughts, notes, or ideas on the canvas. To create a block, double-click on the canvas, type in the quick add hit `Enter`. To embed a block from your graph, use the quick add feature to search for it and select it from the results. You can also drag and drop a block from any page or block into your whiteboard. Blocks on your whiteboard can be resized, moved, grouped, linked, or styled as you wish.
