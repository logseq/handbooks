To add an image to a block, you use the standard Markdown syntax: `![alt text](url)` where `alt text` is a description of the image and `url` is the link to the image file.

You can also use local files by using relative paths. For example, `![my image](./my-image.jpg)`. The embedded images will show up as thumbnails that you can click to view in full size. You can also resize the image by dragging its bottom left corner with your mouse.

You can also add an image to a block by using the `/upload` command. The file that you upload will be copied to your `assets` folder (inside the folder where you've saved your Logseq graph).
