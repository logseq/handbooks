You can insert images into your notes with Logseq. You can use it to add visual elements, diagrams, or screenshots. To embed images, you need to use the syntax `![alt text](url)` where `alt text` is a description of the image and url is the link to the image file. You can also use local files by using relative paths. For example, `![my image](./my-image.jpg)`. The embedded images will show up as thumbnails that you can click to view in full size.
