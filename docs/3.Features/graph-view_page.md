Apart from the global graph view, it's also possible to only see the nodes and links related to the page you're currently on. The page graph view helps you focus on a specific topic and explore its connections with other pages in your graph.

You can access the page graph view by opening the right sidebar (shortcut: `t l`) and clicking on the `Page graph view` button at the top.
