You can add a template property to any block in Logseq to save it as a reusable structure for future blocks. Templates are blocks that start with `template::` followed by the `template name` and optionally `template-including-parent::` followed by `true` or `false`. For example, you can add `template:: Standup Meeting` to a block that offers a structure to your daily tasks and goals and use it to create new blocks with the same structure . Templates are useful for saving time and creating consistent formats for your notes.
