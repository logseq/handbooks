Logseq lets you give a name to your whiteboard so you can easily find it later. To name your whiteboard, click on the input box that hangs from the top left of the canvas and type the name you want. The name will be saved as an .edn file in a special “whiteboards” folder in your Logseq graph file system structure. You can also rename your whiteboard anytime by clicking on the input box again and editing the text.
