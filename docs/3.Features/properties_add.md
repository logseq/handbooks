You can add custom properties to any page or block in Logseq to store additional information and use them in queries. Properties are key-value pairs that start with `property-title::` followed by the value. For example, you can add a property called `status` to a block and assign it a value like `done` or `pending`. You can then use queries to filter your blocks by their status. Properties are useful for organizing your notes and managing your tasks more efficiently.
