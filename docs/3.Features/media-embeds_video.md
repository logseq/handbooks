You can insert video files or YouTube videos into your notes with Logseq. You can use it to watch lectures, tutorials, or presentations. To embed video, you need to use the syntax `{{video url}}` where `url` is the link to the video file or YouTube video. For example, `{{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvFr36bcpYc}}`. The embedded video will show up as a player that you can control with buttons. You can also take notes on the video and sync them with the timestamps.
