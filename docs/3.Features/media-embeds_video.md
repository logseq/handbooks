You can insert video files or online video (YouTube and Vimeo) into your Logseq notes.

To embed a video, you use the syntax `{{video url}}` where `url` is the path to the video file or URL of the online video. For example, `{{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvFr36bcpYc}}`

The embedded video will show up as a player that you can control with buttons. You can also take notes underneath the video and quickly add timestamps that will take you to the spot in the video upon clicking on it. **TK ADD LINK TO YOUTUBE TIMESTAMPS ARTICLE**
