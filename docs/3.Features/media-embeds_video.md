You can insert video files or online video (YouTube and Vimeo) into your Logseq notes.

To embed a video, you use the syntax `{{video url}}` where `url` is the path to the video file or URL of the online video. For example, `{{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvFr36bcpYc}}`

The embedded video will show up as a player that you can control with buttons. You can also take notes on the video and sync them with the timestamps. **TK ADD LINK TO ARTICLE**
