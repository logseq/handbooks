You can mark important parts of a PDF document with different colors with Logseq. You can use it to emphasize key points, quotes, or definitions. To highlight text, you need to open a PDF file in Logseq and select the text you want to highlight. Then you can choose a color from the floating toolbar. The highlighted text will be extracted as a block in your notes and linked to the original PDF page. This feature allows you to easily create highlight blocks from your PDF documents that you can connect with your own thoughts by referencing or embedding them in your notes.
