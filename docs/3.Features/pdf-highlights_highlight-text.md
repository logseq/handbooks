Highlight text is a feature of Logseq that allows you to mark important parts of a PDF document with different colors. You can use it to emphasize key points, quotes, or definitions. To highlight text, you need to open a PDF file in Logseq and select the text you want to highlight. Then you can choose a color from the floating toolbar. The highlighted text will be extracted as a block in your notes and linked to the original PDF page. You can also edit, comment, or reference the highlighted text in your notes.
