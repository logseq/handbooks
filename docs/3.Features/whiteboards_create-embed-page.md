Logseq lets you create and embed pages on your whiteboard that can contain an outline of blocks, headings, lists, or other elements. The canvas allows you to place many pages right next to each other, enabling new types of workflows. To create a page, double-click on the canvas, type in the `quick add` input field that opens up and select the second option from the top `New page:`. To embed a page from your graph, use the same quick add feature to search for it and select it from the results. You can also drag and drop a page from the left or right sidebar into your whiteboard. Pages on your whiteboard can be resized, moved, grouped, linked, or styled as you wish.
