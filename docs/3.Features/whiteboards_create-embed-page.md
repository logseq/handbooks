Spread pages on a whiteboard to organize your knowledge in space. Pages are containers of blocks that can form an outline of headings, lists, or other elements. The canvas allows you to place many pages next to each other, enabling new types of workflows. To create a page, double-click on the canvas and type a title in the quick add box. Select the second option from the top `New page:`. To embed a page from your graph, use the same quick add box to search for it and select it from the results. You can also drag and drop a page from the left or right sidebar into your whiteboard. Pages on your whiteboard can be resized, moved, grouped, linked, or styled as you wish. You might get a birds-eye view on your projects and discover new ways of working by arranging them like pieces of paper on a physical desk.
