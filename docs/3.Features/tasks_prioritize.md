Assign different priorities to your tasks by typing `[#A]`, `[#B]`, or `[#C]` at the end of the block or using commands (`/A`, `/B`, `/C`). You can also use queries to filter and sort your tasks by priority, such as `(or (todo now) (and (todo later) [#A]))`. Logseq helps you focus on what matters most and get things done.
