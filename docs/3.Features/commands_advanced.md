Advanced commands are those that can be accessed by typing < and open an autocomplete context menu that offers options such as “Quote”, “Src”, “Query”, “Latex export”, etc. Advanced commands allow you to insert special blocks into your notes that have different functions and formats. For example, you can use the “Query” command to write a Datalog query that can filter and display data from your Logseq graph. You can also use the “Src” command to write code blocks with syntax highlighting. Advanced commands can help you create more complex and dynamic notes with Logseq.
