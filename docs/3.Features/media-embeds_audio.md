With Logseq, you can add audio to your notes. 

To embed audio, you need to use the following Markdown syntax `![](url)` where `url` is the link to the audio file. You can also use local files by using relative paths. For example, `![]( ./my-audio.mp3)`.

You can also add audio to a block by using the `/upload` command. The file that you upload will be copied to your `assets` folder (inside the folder where you've saved your Logseq graph).

The embedded audio will show up as a player that you can control with buttons.
