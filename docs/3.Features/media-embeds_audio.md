Logseq allows you to insert audio files into your notes. You can use it to record your voice, add sound effects, or play music. To embed audio, you need to use the syntax `{{audio: url}}` where url is the link to the audio file. You can also use local files by using relative paths. For example, `{{audio: ./my-audio.mp3}}`. The embedded audio will show up as a player that you can control with buttons.
