You can insert audio files into your notes with Logseq. You can use it to record your voice, play podcast recordings or music. To embed audio, you need to use the syntax `{{audio: url}}` where `url` is the link to the audio file. You can also use local files by using relative paths. For example, `{{audio: ./my-audio.mp3}}`. The embedded audio will show up as a player that you can control with buttons.
