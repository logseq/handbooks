Set up Zotero connection: To connect your Zotero account to Logseq and sync your library, follow these steps:
- Create a Zotero account and enable syncing on the Zotero website.
- Create a new API key here and note down your user ID or group ID from the same page. Make sure to select the permissions you want for your key, such as library access and notes access.
- Open Logseq app and click on the `…` menu in the top bar. Then select `Settings` and click `Zotero settings`.
- Enter your API key and user ID or group ID in the fields provided. Click `Save` to confirm.
- You should see a message that says “Zotero connected successfully”. Now you can import your Zotero items as Logseq pages in two ways:
    - Use the `/Zotero` command in any page to search and import individual items by typing any keyword. Select the item you want from the list and it will be added as a Logseq page with a link to the original source.
    - Go back to the `Zotero settings` and click `Add all` to import all your Zotero items at once as Logseq pages. By default, they will have an `@` prefix added to their names, but you can customize it in the settings. You will get a notification that says “Successfully added all items!” when done.
By setting up Zotero connection, you can easily access and manage your research sources in Logseq. You can also annotate them, link them with other notes, or cite them in your writing.
