You can hide parts of a sentence with `{{…}}` to create clozes in Logseq. Clozes are blanks that you have to fill in by recalling the hidden information. For example, try typing into a block `Logseq supports {{Markdown}} and {{Orgmode}} syntax #card`. When you review your flashcards, you will see the sentence with the hidden parts replaced by `[…]`. You can reveal the answer by clicking on the `[…]` or pressing `Enter`. If you don’t want to type doube curly brackets, you can type `/Cloze` instead. Creating clozes can help you test your recall and comprehension with Logseq.
