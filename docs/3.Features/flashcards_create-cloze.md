Cloze deletion is a technique that helps you fill in the blanks in a sentence by hiding parts of it with {{...}}. For example, try typing into a block `Logseq supports {{Markdown}} and {{Orgmode}} syntax #card`. When you review your flashcards, you will see the sentence with the hidden parts replaced by [...]. You can reveal the answer by clicking on the [...] or pressing Enter. If you don't want to type doube curly brackets, you can type `/Cloze` instead. Creating clozes can help you test your recall and comprehension with Logseq.
