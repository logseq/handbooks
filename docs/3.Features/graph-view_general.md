The graph view is a feature that allows you to see a visual representation of all the pages and links in your Logseq graph. You can access it by clicking on the `Graph view` tab in the left sidebar. A view will open that shows you a network of nodes and edges, where each node is a page and each edge is a link between pages. You can zoom in and out, drag and drop nodes, search for nodes, and click on any node to open its page. This general graph view helps you get an overview of your knowledge structure, discover connections, and navigate your graph. It also makes a great screenshot to show off the size of your second brain. ðŸ˜‰
