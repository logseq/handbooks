Did you know that you can visually see the connections between the notes in your graph? This is called the graph view.

The graph view shows you a network of nodes and edges, where each node is a page and each edge is a link between pages. You can access it by clicking on the `Graph view` button in the left sidebar.

In the graph view you can zoom in and out, drag and drop nodes, search for nodes, and click on any node to open its page. The graph view helps you get an overview of your knowledge structure, discover connections, and navigate your notes. *(It also makes a great screenshot to show off the size of your second brain ðŸ˜‰)*
