Search Zotero items: Use the `/Zotero` command in any page to search and import your Zotero items by typing any keyword. You can also type the name of an author, a title, a year, or a tag to find specific items in your library. Select the item you want from the list and it will be added as a Logseq page with a link to the original source. This feature allows you to quickly find and access your research sources in Logseq without leaving your current page.
