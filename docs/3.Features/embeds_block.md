Block embeds are a way to insert a block and all of its children from another place into your current block. Block embeds show the content of the original block and update automatically if you make any changes to it. You can also see the breadcrumb of the embedded block, which shows you where it comes from. To create a block embed, you can type `/block embed` and hit Enter, or type `{{embed (())}}` and then search for the block you want to embed. Block embeds can help you reuse and organize your notes across different pages.
