Draw on an infinite canvas that syncs with your notes. You can create a new whiteboard by:

- Clicking on the “Whiteboards” section in the left sidebar and then clicking on the big plus button that says “New whiteboard”.
- Clicking on the “Create” button at the bottom of the left sidebar and selecting “New whiteboard” from the menu.
- Pressing CMD+K to open the search and create menu, typing some text and selecting “New whiteboard: {the text you typed}” from the results.

Once you create a new whiteboard, you can start drawing with your mouse or touchpad. You can also use different tools like shapes, colors, or text. Whiteboards are useful for brainstorming, visualizing, or planning anything you want.
