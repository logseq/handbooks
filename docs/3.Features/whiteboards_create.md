Logseq lets you draw on an infinite canvas that syncs with your notes. To create a new whiteboard, you have three options:

- Click on the “Whiteboards” section in the left sidebar and then click on the big plus button that says “New whiteboard”.
- Click on the “Create” button at the bottom of the left sidebar and select “New whiteboard” from the menu.
- Press CMD+K to open the search and create menu, type some text and select “New whiteboard: {the text you typed}” from the results.

Once you create a new whiteboard, you can start drawing with your mouse or touchpad. You can also use different tools like shapes, colors, or text. Whiteboards are useful for brainstorming, visualizing, or planning anything you want.
