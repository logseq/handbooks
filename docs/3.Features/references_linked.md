With Logseq, you can see all the pages that link to the current page using page references. You can do this by scrolling down to the bottom of the page. The `Linked references` section is a query that will show you the respective page title and a context snippet of each block that contains a link to the current page using `[[` syntax. You can click on any linked reference to go to that page. This feature helps you discover connections and explore your notes more deeply.
