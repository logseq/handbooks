Page embeds are a way to insert a whole page into another page in Logseq. They show the content of the original page and update automatically if you make any changes to it. 

Page embeds can help you create nested pages and see related information in one place. You can also collapse or expand the embedded page as you wish, enabling you to only have the information at hand that you need in the moment.

To create a page embed, you can type `/page embed` and hit `Enter`, or type `{{embed [[Page Name]]}}` and replace `Page Name` with the name of the page you want to embed.
