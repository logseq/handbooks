Page embeds are a way to insert a whole page into another page in Logseq. Page embeds show the content of the original page and update automatically if you make any changes to it. You can also collapse or expand the embedded page as you wish. To create a page embed, you can type `/page embed` and hit Enter, or type `{{embed [[Page Name]]}}` and replace Page Name with the name of the page you want to embed. Page embeds can help you create nested pages and see related information in one place.
