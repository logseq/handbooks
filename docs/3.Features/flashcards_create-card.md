With Logseq, you can turn any block into a flashcard for spaced repetition learning. Spaced repetition is a technique that helps you remember things by reviewing them at optimal intervals. You just need to add a `#card` tag and use `::` to separate the front and back of the card. For example you can try typing `What is Logseq? :: A privacy-first, open-source platform for knowledge management and collaboration #card` into a block and then review it by clicking on the `Flashcards` button on the left sidebar. Creating flashcards helps you learn and memorize anything with Logseq.
