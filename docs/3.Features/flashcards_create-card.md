With Logseq, you can turn any block into a flashcard for spaced repetition learning. Spaced repetition is a technique that helps you remember things by reviewing them at optimal intervals.

To create a flashcard, you only need to add a `#card` tag to a branch to turn it into a flashcard. The block containing the `#card` tag will be the front of the flashcard; all of its child block will be on the back of the card.

## Cloze deletion cards
Apart from simple question and answer, you can also create cloze deletion cards in Logseq.

By wrapping part of a card between curly brackets, `{{}}`, you hide it from a sentence. If you don’t want to type double curly brackets, you can type `/Cloze` instead.

Remember to also add the `#card` tag to a cloze deletion card, otherwise it will not appear during your flashcard reviews.

When reviewing your cloze flashcards, you'll see the sentence with the hidden parts replaced by `[…]`. You can reveal the answer by clicking on the `[…]` or pressing `Enter`.
