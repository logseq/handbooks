Create flashcard is a feature that allows you to make your own flashcards for spaced repetition learning in Logseq. Spaced repetition is a technique that helps you remember things by reviewing them at optimal intervals. You can create flashcards from any block in Logseq by adding a `#card` tag and using `::` to separate the front and back of the card. For example you can try typing `What is Logseq? :: A privacy-first, open-source platform for knowledge management and collaboration #card` into a block and then review it by clicking on the Flashcards button on the left sidebar. Creating flashcards helps you learn and memorize anything with Logseq.
