Logseq lets you see all the pages that mention the current page without linking to it. You can do this by scrolling to the `Unlinked References` section at the bottom of the page. This query will show you the respective page title and a context snippet of each block that contains a mention of the current page without using `[[` syntax. You can edit any unlinked reference directly on the page and add brackets around it to turn it into a linked reference. This feature helps you find potential connections and enrich your notes more easily.
