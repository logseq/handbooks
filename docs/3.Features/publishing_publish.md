You can export your Logseq notes as a static website and host it on your own domain or GitHub pages. You can publish your graph by clicking on the “Export” button in the `…` menu in the top bar and choosing the “Export public pages” option. You can also use GitHub actions or other methods to automate the deployment process. Only the pages that have a `public:: true` property will be included in the published site.
