You can see all the highlights you made on a PDF document through a context menu in the top bar. You can access this menu by clicking on the `Outline` button on the top of the PDF reader and switching the tab from `Contents` to `Highlights`. You can also see your highlights in a separate file named `hls_PDF-title-name`, but it might be out of sync.
