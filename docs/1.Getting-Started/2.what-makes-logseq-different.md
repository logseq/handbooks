## What makes Logseq different?
**Logseq is an outliner.** Each bullet is a block, which you can best compare to a paragraph. Because Logseq is an outliner, every paragraph in Logseq is preceded by a bullet. Need more than a single paragraph? Create _branches_ by grouping related blocks.

**Logseq is a _networked_ outliner.** You can connect any block, from anywhere in your notes collection. Creating copies of blocks is as easy as dragging your mouse. Remix your ideas in new outlines in minutes. Everything in Logseq is about the block; throughout this guide we'll see the opportunities of this concept.

Logseq is different compared to traditional note-taking apps. Most notes tools try to emulate paper and folders, meaning that each note is located in precisely one folder. This makes remixing your notes difficult, and often leads to having several copies of slightly different notes. Logseq aims to solve this so you can focus on doing your best thinking.

In the coming lessons we’ll dive deep into what this freedom of information enables us to do. For now it’s enough to understand that **every bullet is a block** and that it can connect to any other block or collection of blocks (pages).
