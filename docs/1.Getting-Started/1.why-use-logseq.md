Do you feel overwhelmed by information? Are you constantly looking for your notes, not knowing where you saved them?

Logseq is the answer to your knowledge work challenges. With Logseq, you can offload your thoughts in seconds, and find them back years later.

Whether you need to capture a task, meeting notes, or even run entire projects, Logseq has your back. And best of all: no eyes are spying on your notes, as Logseq stores everything on your device and encrypts your notes before [syncing](../2.sync) them.

But what makes Logseq truly different from most other notes apps?

In this app, you write everything in *lists*. **Logseq is an outliner**, which means that you structure your notes while you type, in simple bulleted lists. And with this ease of structuring information, you no longer need to think about how to name a note or where to store it.

So how does a simple outlining app enable you to take, structure, and find your notes with ease? That’s the topic of this onboarding guide.

In the next four articles, you’ll learn everything you need to know about Logseq and outlines. Soon, you'll stop forgetting and start getting more productive.

While we’ll present the core features and a simple note-taking workflow, Logseq does not impose a structure on your notes. Within the limitations of the outline, you can shape your knowledge as you wish. And with Logseq’s rich plugin ecosystem—and the fact that the app is open source—the possibilities are endless.

For now, let’s focus on the three most important concepts in Logseq:

* Blocks
* Pages
* References

We’ll start with a brief overview of these core concepts, before zooming in on each one.
