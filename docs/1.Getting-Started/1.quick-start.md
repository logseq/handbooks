# Outline

- Logseq is not just a note-taking tool; it's an information management tool
- Examples of common types of notes:
    - Collection of thoughts
    - List of tasks and goals
    - Reflections on events
- Information management lifecycle:
    - Input: Capturing or creating information
    - Retrieval: Searching or organic (re)discovery of information
    - Organization: Structuring, managing, editing, and processing information
    - Output: Completing or publishing a piece of information/knowledge
- The activities in the information management lifecycle are no linear; knowledge workers tend to go back and forth between steps
    - Logseq's advantage is that switching between contexts/activities is quick, because you can easily filter out information and zoom in on a specific collection of notes
- Logseq's journals page takes away the question: where do I put this?
    - The outline structure helps to organize notes without it taking up any time (structuring becomes part of the writing process because it's a single keystroke to group together information)
        - With Logseq, the location of the information does not matter, as long as you've associated the information with at least one other piece of information â€” be it another piece of information (a block in an outline), a page, or a link
