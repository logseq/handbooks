Logseq has many features. When you just get started using this app, you may feel that you need to understand all of them to get value out of it. However, you need less than a handful of features to boost your productivity with Logseq.

In this part of the onboarding guide, we’ll have a brief look at Logseq’s core features:

- Blocks and branches
- Journals and pages
- Page and block references

Confused about what these words mean? Let’s define things first.

## Blocks and branches

Whenever you open Logseq, you always start on the journals section. This is a list of all of your journals pages, showing the most recent date first. In a bit we’ll get to what these journals pages do exactly, but first we need to take a moment to understand the core concept of Logseq: blocks and branches.

On that page with today’s date, you see a single bullet. This is called a _block_ in Logseq, and it’s the smallest piece of information you can work with in this app. You can compare blocks to paragraphs in a regular text editor.

To group multiple blocks (paragraphs) that are related to each other, you create _branches_ in Logseq. In a regular text editor this would be a subheading with multiple paragraphs.

In the next part of this guide we’ll dive deep into blocks and branches.

## Journals and pages
We already mentioned them: journals. But what are these random pages with dates?

Every time you open Logseq, it will open on the journal page for that day. It does this to give you a place to quickly capture notes. And best of all: every block and branch you put on a journal page is automatically tagged with that date (we’ll dive much deeper into this in the part on page references).

But you don’t have to write everything on a journal page. Logseq gives you several options to create so-called _titled pages_. You can give these pages any title you want, and many people use pages to group related notes.

We’ll go into much more detail about recommended workflows for journals and titled pages later in this guide.

## Page and block references
Also called just _links_, page references point to pages (either journals or titled pages). On the other hand, block references point to single blocks.

Clicking on a page reference will take you to its page and show all of the contents of that page.

Clicking on a block reference will show all of the contents of its branch inline.

You can best compare a page reference to a webpage URL, and a block reference to a link to a specific subheading of a webpage.

Towards the end of this guide we’ll have a look at how to use references to search and navigate your notes. For now, let’s take a step back and have a closer look at blocks.
