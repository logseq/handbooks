**Welcome to Logseq!** This is your new dedicated environment for learning and thinking.

To help you get started figuring out the workflows that work for you, we will take you through all of Logseq's core features. See them as tools in your toolbox; individually a tool will do little, but once you learn to use them in combination you can build powerful knowledge workflows.

Before we dive into the overview of Logseq's functionality, let's first dig a bit deeper into what makes Logseq special. As we said before; Logseq looks simple on the surface. But looks can be deceptive.
