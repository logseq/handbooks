These limits have been in effect since November 2022:

- **Maximum number of remote graphs:** 10
- **Maximum graph size (per graph):** 10 gigabyte
- **Maximum asset size (per asset):** 100 megabyte

Based on feedback and users' needs, we might change these limits at a later stage. We're also considering different storage tiers.
